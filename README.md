# Keylogger Project

Hello, thank you for viewing my project!

I have always been intrigued by the inner workings of keyloggers and how they function. This curiosity served as the primary inspiration for embarking on this project.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is twofold: firstly, to satisfy my curiosity about keyloggers and delve into their technical intricacies; and secondly, to acquire practical knowledge and skills in software development, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity.

Educational Focus:
This project provides an opportunity to deepen my understanding of input/output operations, file handling, and networking protocols through hands-on experimentation. By exploring the ethical implications of working with sensitive data, I aim to enhance my knowledge of cybersecurity concepts and responsible software development practices.

Ethical Considerations:
It is essential to emphasize that this project is conducted strictly for educational purposes. I am committed to ethical coding practices and responsible usage of technology. By creating this keylogger, I aim to broaden my technical skills while upholding the highest standards of ethical behavior.

Thank you for your interest in my project, and I hope you find it informative and enlightening!
