## Description
The Keylogger Project is a Python script designed to create a basic keylogger with email capability for learning purposes. It allows users to monitor and log keyboard input, and optionally send the logged keystrokes via email. The project serves as an educational tool for understanding the technical nuances of keyloggers and enhancing knowledge in cybersecurity.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is for two reasons: first, to satisfy my curiosity about keyloggers and dive into their technical intricacies; and second, to acquire practical knowledge and skills in software development, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity.

## Features
- **Keystroke Logging:** Captures and logs keystrokes typed by the user.
- **Email Capability:** Sends logged keystrokes via email using SMTP protocol.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Includes warning message about the ethical use of the program.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language used to develop the keylogger script.
- **Pynput:** Library used to monitor and control keyboard input.
- **Smtplib:** Library used to send emails using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script.
2. Press keys on your keyboard to log keystrokes.
3. Optionally, input your email credentials when prompted to send the logged keystrokes via email.

**Note:** Use this program responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
